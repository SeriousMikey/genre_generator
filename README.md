# Overview
This app generates random genres and dimensions. Some examples are "2D Action Adventure" and "3D RPG Party". You can toggle the genres you want to exclude so they won't appear on generation.

I wanted a way to get random genres easily, so I decided to make it for myself.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and Android Studio to develop the app.

I used React Native as the programming language, and Expo and Node.js as the libraries.

# Future Work

* Let the user select how many genres they can have in a generation
* Let the user select how many generations to perform at one time
* Add more genres
* Make the app look better
